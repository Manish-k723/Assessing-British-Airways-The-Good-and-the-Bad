# Data Science Virtual Internship with British Airways
This project is part of the Data Science Virtual Internship program offered by Forage in collaboration with British Airways.

## Overview of the Virtual Internship
The virtual internship consists of two main tasks:
Task 1: Web Scraping for Customer Reviews and Company Insights
Task 2: Predicting Customer Buying Behavior

## Task 1 - Web Scraping to Gain Company Insights
Customers' interactions with the BA brand are diverse when booking a flight. Understanding their feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including British Airways. This task focuses on scraping and collecting customer feedback and review data from a third-party source. The collected data will be analyzed to uncover insights that provide valuable information about customer sentiments and opinions.

The customer review data collected from [Skytrax](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways/) has been meticulously analyzed and summarized. The key findings and insights have been compiled into a concise slide presentation, which can be found below.
